								<span class="image main"><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emmanuel.elizarraga/viz/PortlandAirBnBFullProject/Dashboard1"><img src="images/Portland AirBnB Project.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>

							<p><b>Portland, OR AirBnB (2024-2025) Project - CLICK ON THE IMAGE ABOVE</b>
							<p>Having a close connection to Portland, I was particularly interested in exploring how Airbnb listings are distributed across the city and how they contribute to the local community. This project allowed me to combine my passion for data analysis with a real-world application, providing valuable insights into a sector that is both economically significant and rapidly evolving. This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes Airbnb data for Portland for the years 2024-2025. The dashboard includes various charts to analyze room type listings, revenue trends, and pricing across neighborhoods.</p>
								
							<p><b>Business Questions</b>
								<ol>
								<li>What is the distribution of different room types in Portland?</li>
								<li>Which room types are most popular in different neighborhoods?</li>
								<li>What are the monthly revenue trends for Airbnb in Portland for 2024-2025?</li>
								<li>What are the average prices of Airbnb listings in different neighborhoods?</li></p>
								</ol>

							<p><b>Dashboard Process</b>
								
									<dt><b>Step 1: Data Preparation</b></dt>
										<p>Obtaining the Airbnb data for Portland, Oregon, for the years 2024-2025 directly from thE AirBnB website. I ensured the dataset included information on room types, prices, revenue, neighborhoods, and dates. Using tools such as Excel and MySQL to clean the data that removed duplicates, missing values, and standardizing date formats.</p>

									<dt><b>Step 2: Import Data into Tableau</b></dt>
									<p>Afterwards, I connected the cleaned dataset into a CSV/Excel file to Tableau servers by navigating to the “Data” menu and selectng “New Data Source.”</p>

									<dt><b>Step 3: Create the Dashboard</b></dt>
										<p>Next, I would create the indivdiual charts, based on the buisness questions asked. When all the charts have been created after manipultaing the data. Each one was put into the dashboard. You will find the types of charts below:</p>
										<li>Distinct Count of Room Type Listings</li>
										<li>Revenue by Month</li>
										<li>Room Type Price by Neighborhood</li>
										<li>Price by Neighborhood</li>
									<p></p>

									<dt><b>Step 4: Enhance the Dashboard</b></dt>
										Below are ways I enchaced the dashboard to make it more visually appealing and to show key insght metrics:
										<li>Interactivity</li>
										<li>Aesthetics</li>
										<li>Validation</li>
									<p></p>

									<dt><b>Step 5: Provide Key Insights</b></dt>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Dominance of Entire Home/Apt Listings:</b> The dominance of entire home/apartment listings indicates a strong preference for privacy and space. Marketing efforts could emphasize the benefits of having an entire place to oneself, especially for families or larger groups.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><b>Seasonal Revenue Trends:</b> The trendline added to the revenue chart is helpful. The peak months likely correspond to the summer season, which is typically a high travel period. Understanding these trends can help in planning marketing campaigns and adjusting pricing strategies.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><b>Neighborhood-Specific Strategies:</b> High-priced neighborhoods might benefit from marketing that emphasizes luxury and exclusive experiences. For lower-priced neighborhoods, marketing could highlight value and affordability, perhaps appealing to longer stays or budget travelers.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><b>Price Variation Across Neighborhoods:</b> Significant price variations across neighborhoods suggest a diverse market. High-priced neighborhoods like King and Richmond may be more desirable due to their location or amenities. Lower-priced neighborhoods might attract more budget-conscious travelers or offer different types of accommodations.</li>
									</ol>

									<b>Conclusion</b>
										<li><b>Key Takeaways</b></li>
											<ol>
											<li><b>Strategic Pricing and Marketing:</b> Hosts can use the insights from this analysis to adjust their pricing and marketing strategies according to seasonal trends and neighborhood demand to optimize their revenue.</li>
											<li><b>Investment Opportunities:</b> Potential investors can identify high-performing neighborhoods and room types to make informed decisions about where to invest in new properties.</li>
											<li><b>Enhanced Guest Experience:</b> Understanding the preferences of travelers (e.g., preference for entire home/apartment listings) can help hosts tailor their offerings to better meet guest expectations, potentially leading to higher satisfaction and repeat bookings.</li>
											</ol>
										<li><b>Future Considerations:</b></li>
											<ol>
											<li><b>Impact of Regulatory Changes:</b> Future analyses should consider potential regulatory changes affecting short-term rentals in Portland, as these could significantly impact market dynamics.</li>
											<li><b>Longitudinal Data Analysis:</b> Continuing to monitor and analyze data over time will provide deeper insights into long-term trends and emerging patterns in the Airbnb market.</li>
											<li><b>Competitive Landscape:</b> Examining the competitive landscape, including the impact of other short-term rental platforms and hotels, could offer a more holistic view of the accommodation market in Portland.</li>
